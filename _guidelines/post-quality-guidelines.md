These guidelines are **NOT** required reading, but, a moderator may choose to
refuse a post if it fails to comply with any of these guidelines.  In the end
it's a judgement call of the moderation staff, but, obeying these give your
posts the best chance of making it through to the group! 

* Posts **MUST** be in English. 
* Posts **SHOULD** be the best spelling and grammar you are capable of.  
* Posts **SHOULD** be as self-contained as possible.  You **MAY** link to blog articles,
outside resources, etc.  However, the post itself **SHOULD** contain content,
discussion, or other material to make it worthwhile on it's own merit. 
* * For the purpose of the above, links to github, gists, and various pastebins, do
**NOT** count as outside resources, interpret these links as part of post content. 
* Posts **SHOULD** be related to technology, programming, etc.  
* Posts asking for programming help **SHOULD** be as detailed as possible.  These
**SHOULD** include steps tried, previous searches, and relevant code samples in
github, a gist, or pastebin.  These **MUST NOT** contain ugly pastes of code
directly into the post or screenshots of code.  These **MAY** include screenshots
of the results of running the code. 
* Posts **MUST NOT** contain links to pirate material such as e-books, PDFs, paid
content, etc. 
* Posts **MUST NOT** contain personally identifiable information of any other member
and **SHOULD NOT** contain your own information. 
* Posts **SHOULD NOT** be self-promotion. 
* Posts **SHOULD NOT** contain links to binaries or compiled code and executables. 
 
For clarification on **BOLD** terms, see [this link](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
